# express-hmr-react

Like so many before me, it's been a long tortuous journey to finding a webpack config that was to my liking.  This repo is just to ensure I have a good starting point for future express/react projects.

Using express + webpack-dev-middleware + HMR + react-hot-loader for HMR doesn't seem to be the best-beaten path for this style of development.  Resources and examples for it are sparse, often conflict, and very often don't work.  Also with the rapidly changing API's of webpack, react, react-hot-loader, many of them are out of date.
